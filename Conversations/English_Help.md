User: what are some examples in history of people's view of society being distorted because of their past? name some people and their situation
APOLLO: Sir Cotterman, historical perspectives on societies have often been shaped by prior events that left lasting impressions or traumas upon individuals. Here are a few notable instances:

1. **Post-World War II Generations in Germany**: Individuals who grew up during the Nazi era experienced distorted views of society due to indoctrination and propaganda.
   - *Example*: Hans Scholl, founder of the White Rose movement.

2. **Vietnam Veterans Post-Vietnam War (U.S.)**: Many returning soldiers faced societal distortion as their experiences clashed with prevailing patriotic narratives back home in America after a controversial war that divided public opinion deeply.
   - Example: Ron Kovic from *Born on the Fourth of July* who was profoundly affected by his wartime experience and later became an anti-war activist.

3. **Post-Civil Rights Movement (U.S.)**: African Americans faced societal distortions due to entrenched racial prejudices, even after significant legislative progress.
   - Example: Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., whose efforts highlighted continuing systemic racism despite the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and subsequent legislation aimed at ending segregation.

These examples demonstrate how deeply rooted historical events can shape collective consciousness in ways that distort societal perceptions for generations to come.
User: if I was writing an essay on how someone's background effects them and my first two points were their view of themselves and their view of others, what could be the third point?
APOLLO: Sir Cotterman, if you're expanding your thesis about personal backgrounds affecting individuals' views in three key areas—self-perception, perception of others—and you wish to add a tertiary aspect such as "view on societal structures or systems," here's an elaboration:

3. **View on Societal Structures/Social Systems**: Someone's background significantly influences how they perceive and interact with broader social institutions like government bodies, economic entities (e.g., financial markets), educational frameworks, etc.

*Example*: Individuals who grew up in economically disadvantaged environments might view societal structures such as the banking system or tax policies differently compared to those from affluent backgrounds. For instance:

- *Example 1:* A person raised during an era of high inflation and poverty may have a cynical outlook on governmental economic interventions.
  
- *Example 2*: Children growing under oppressive regimes (e.g., apartheid in South Africa) often develop distrust towards political institutions that perpetuate inequality.

These examples show how one's formative experiences with societal structures can deeply influence their attitudes toward these systems, adding another dimension to the understanding of personal backgrounds' impact on individual perspectives.

APOLLO: Sir Cotterman,

Certainly! Here are more nuanced instances from both literary works and historical contexts demonstrating individuals’ perceptions shaped by their formative environments:

1. **Literary Example - "Les Misérables" (Victor Hugo)**: Jean Valjean, the protagonist of Victor Hugo's novel *Les Misérables*, was profoundly affected as a child when he stole bread to feed his sister’s starving family and subsequently faced harsh punishment for this act.
   - His experiences shaped an initially cynical view on society—seeing it through lenses marred by poverty. However, these formative struggles also led him down the path of immense compassion toward others who suffered similarly.

2. **Historical Example – Nelson Mandela**: The anti-apartheid revolutionary was born into a rural Zulu family where he first encountered injustice firsthand.
   - His early exposure to racial segregation and discriminatory practices shaped his perception that society is unjustly divided along race lines, fueling both personal conviction against apartheid in South Africa as well as broader societal change.

3. **Literary Example – "The Great Gatsby" (F. Scott Fitzgerald)**: Jay Gatsby's upbringing was characterized by poverty during the early 20th century.
   - His background led to a deep-seated belief that wealth and status were essential for happiness, ultimately influencing his relentless pursuit of success in an attempt to reshape society according to his distorted self-view.

These examples illustrate how formative experiences rooted deeply within one's societal context can mold profound perceptions about broader social structures. The characters' backgrounds lead them into complex interactions with the societies they inhabit—illustrating a rich tapestry where literature and historical events converge, offering insights on human resilience shaped by personal adversity against larger systemic backdrops.

APOLLO: Sir Cotterman,

In concluding this exploration of how one's background shapes their perceptions across self-view, views towards others, as well as societal structures or systems in general:

Through the intricate interplay between individual experiences and broader historical contexts—as vividly illustrated through characters like Jean Valjean from *Les Misérables*, Nelson Mandela’s anti-apartheid struggle, Jay Gatsby's pursuit of material wealth—we can observe that one's formative environment significantly molds their perceptions. Whether it is a personal sense of inadequacy or an overarching cynicism towards societal institutions born out of injustice and poverty experienced firsthand; these perspectives are deeply rooted in the unique tapestry each individual's life unfolds within.

The narratives we draw from both historical accounts and literary masterpieces serve not merely as reflections but also as poignant reminders that our backgrounds, though seemingly disparate on a grand scale, profoundly influence how individuals interact with their world. Thus it becomes incumbent upon us to approach these complex interrelations through empathetic understanding rather than dismissive judgment—recognizing the formative power of one's past in shaping attitudes and perspectives towards society at large.

In summation, recognizing that our backgrounds are not merely backdrops but active canvases continually informing how we view ourselves—and by extension others within societal constructs—is essential. By acknowledging these dimensions with nuance—the personal interwoven deeply into historical threads—we gain a richer understanding of human resilience amidst adversity against larger systemic landscapes.
