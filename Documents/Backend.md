Backend is the back or inner-workings of the programs. This is what saves and manages the data. 


#### Servers
A server is a computer that receives messages and returns data for a program. An example being if a place an order on amazon my computer, the "Client", sends the order to amazon's computer, the "Server". However, computers can't receive messages from the internet by default they have to be programmed to do so with Backend Programming Languages. A message sent from the frontend is called a "Request" and what the backend sends back is called a "Response". This together is called a Request-Response Cycle. There are certain types of requests like POST, GET, PUT, DELETE, etc. These are called REST or Representational State transfer. The type of requests means something like POST means to create something.  

#### Backend Programming Language
Some examples of Backend Programming Languages are:
- [[JavaScript]] (NodeJS)
- [[Python]]
- Ruby
- Java
Backend Programming languages are not used on their own as that would use a shit ton of code so they use tools called a Backend Framework and a Package Manager.

#### Backend Frameworks
Backend Frameworks are used to make programming backend easier and faster. Some examples of Backend Frameworks are:
- ExpressJS
- Python Django
- Ruby on Rails
- Java Spring

#### Package Manager
A package is code written by other people called packages. These can be used for doing calculations, talking to a database, etc. To install and manage packages you use a Package Manager. Some examples of package managers are:
- NPM for JavaScript
- pip for Python
- bundler for Ruby
- Maven for Java
#### Database
A database is a piece of software used to store and manage data. Some examples of Databases are:
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- MongoDB
#### API
An API or Application Programming Interface are the requests that the program allows and how they should handle them. An API that uses the REST naming convention is called a REST API.  

#### Virtual Machines
A virtual machine is a computer that only exists on the software of a bigger computer. A company will rent one Virtual Machine or VM to run their backend and then one more to run the database. 

#### Microservices
Microservices work by splitting backend work into multiple separate code bases. This helps keep the code bases smaller and more focused. 

#### Cloud Computing 
Companies don't actually buy computers to host their websites or programs instead they rent computers from a cloud computing company like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, etc. Also known as IaaS or Infrastructure as a Service. PaaS or Platform as a Service is a service where a company will set up the VMs and load balancers for you. A SaaS or a Software as a Service is a service where a company will handle a certain tricky coding function for you. IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS together are called Cloud Computing.
