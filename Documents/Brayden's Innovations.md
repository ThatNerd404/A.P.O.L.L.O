Brayden's Innovations is my personal website that I hope to grow to be cool as hell. I am programming it with [[Html]] and [[Css]] , which will make it a static website meaning it won't really have any [[Backend]] programming to it and will be an exclusively [[Frontend]] project.  I was inspired to make this by seeing [[The Old Internet]] and loving the security, privacy, and the customization of websites back then. I need to figure out what direction I plan on going with my website. Meaning I need to know if I'm gonna just let it sit in GitHub pages and pay for a domain name (need to make sure to get domain privacy) and not really be able to share my website easily or try neocities which is fine and dandy but I put my trust into a third-party which could easily just stop being used or worse sell out to a company or I could also try using A.W.S (Amazon Webservices) and hosting from there.

## Random thoughts while working on the project
So far [the website](https://thatnerd404.github.io/Brayden-s-Innovations/) has a animated matrix background with cool green text in a Mario 64 font. 
The title is good but the main content and sidebar need work as they are (obviously) not done.  I have the sidebar done pretty well so far but now I need to work on the main content and add more blinkies as they are so cute and so cool-looking. Holy shit it actually looks half-decent lets go I feel so productive and awesome and stuff. Got this cool text. OMG GET BUFF AND RENAME WEBSITE THE OVERMUSCLED NERD AND KEEP BASICALLY EVERYTHING BUT I HAVE MUSCLES
