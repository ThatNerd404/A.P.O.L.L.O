Frontend is the front or visible end of the websites and programs that you know and love.
[[Website Development]] is the a great example of a frontend job.  
#### JavaScript
[[JavaScript]] is the brains of the website. It gives the website its functionality. An important thing to remember is the Document Object Model or DOM. DOM allows JavaScript to change the webpage. 
##### Bundler
 JavaScript does not have functions that many other programming languages have including the ability to use multiple JavaScript files for one program. This can be fixed however with a Bundler. An example of a Bundler is Webpack, which, lets us split our code into multiple files. 
##### Transpiler
A Transpiler adds extra features onto JavaScript. Then it will transform the code back into regular JavaScript as most browsers can only understand regular JavaScript.

##### JavaScript Framework
Programmers no longer interact to the DOM directly instead opting to use a JavaScript Framework. These Frameworks include ReactJS, Angular, and VueJS.
##### HTML
[[Html]] means HyperText-Markup-Language and is the bones of the website. It gives the website its basic structure.
#### CSS
[[Css]] means Cascading-Style-Sheets and is the face of the website. It gives a website its style. 
##### Preprocessor
Css has similar issues to JavaScript in lacking features like the ability to handle multiple files. This is actually a combination of a Bundler and a Transpiler with the tool SASS. 
##### Css Framework
Css Frameworks are basically Css code that another person has wrote that helps you solve common problems. The most popular of these frameworks being Bootstrap.
