GitHub is a tool used by programmers and in [[Software Development]] to show off their programs to others, to hold their code, and to work with other programmers. Git is a version control software that will record different versions or commits of your code and allow you to go back on bad code.

GitHub also has a service called GitHub pages which is hosting my website, [[Brayden's Innovations]].
