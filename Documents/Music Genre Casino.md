Music Genre Casino is a program that will generate a random genre out of a huge list of genres and then pick one out of the sub-genres.  This program will be made purely in [[Python]]. This program is made for the purpose of quenching my desire to listen to every single genre and sub-genres. This will also have a funny GUI with me as a dealer and a large slot machine with a huge lever. I plan to change this to an executable with a shortcut that I will make a daily routine of spinning in the morning to see what genre I listen to that day.

## Random thoughts while working on the project
Ok so I'm organizing the different genres and subgenres but I think it might just make sense to make the dictionary into just a list of all the subgenres. Finished an animation for it. need to learn to not rely on chatgpt to much. I'm the one coding after all here. Once I learn the fundamentals I should be good. I realize the lever could work as a seperate image of a slot machine with a image of a lever attached to it that when clicked will flick down while the animation is playing then flick back up after. DONT FORGET TO DISABLE IT DURING THE ANIMATION TOO YOU DINGUS. Tkinter sucks so I gotta learn pyside6 and qt designer.
