Pixel art is the type of art that is made by manipulating and coloring the exact pixels of the screen. I got into it because it connects easily to my love for [[Software Development]]. List of my works:
-  [[Daemons]]
- [[Skater AI]]
- [[Para-Social Butterfly]]
- [[Nekojo]]
- [[Snake Conqueror]]
- [[Mixtape]]
- [[Stardew Valley Persona]]
