Software Development is the creation of software (which is the programs and files on computers that make it do the cool stuff you love). Software development involves coding and you code by using programming languages. Software development can also be split into 2 different fields [[Backend]] and [[Frontend]]. An example of Frontend is [[Website Development]]. READ THE DOCUMENTATION to learn new tools! My favorite field is [[AI Development]]
### Programming Languages
Programming Languages are the languages used to create programs.
[[Python]]
[[Html]]
[[Css]]
[[JavaScript]]
### Programming Tools
To program people use a text editor an example being Vscode which I use. [[GitHub]] is a version control software used with groups but still used in solo projects.
### My Journey
The biggest thing learned with learning programming is 1. Take notes using this lovely program and 2. use project based learning. Which basically means using projects to learn about programming. A project I am using to learn [[Website Development]] which is teaching me [[Html]] and [[Css]] is my website, [[Brayden's Innovations]]. I hope with my website that I can emulate the style and wonder of [[The Old Internet]].  I have finished with the first version of my website and have decided to embark on a new journey with my next project, [[Music Genre Casino]]. This program will use [[Python]] to make a gui that puts you in a casino with your dealer, me! I enter and implore you to pull the lever and see what genre I am delighted with today. I have finished with my GUI project and have started on [[Summer In December!!!]] my new PyGame game.  I have finished with my game project and have started on my largest and most ambitious project, [[A.P.O.L.L.O]] an A.I voice assistant.
