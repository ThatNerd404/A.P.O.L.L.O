Summer In December!!! is a pixel art platformer where the objective is to fight through some monsters (based on things that are hot) and get to a freezer before you melt (as you are a snowman).  Coded in [[Python]] with PyGame. The main character is Pete Sleet, a snowman from the North Pool. One day, he decides to leave his snowy home to meet a lady friend, Francesca Flurry! He grabs his trusty snowball launcher and journeys into nice cut lawns, sandy beaches, and a volcano! Fight against tiresome foes and challenge yourself with treacherous platforming in, Summer in December! 
# Recent Developments: I am leaving this project!!!
This is not a failure as I learned exactly what I wanted to learn particularly being if game design is for me. I discovered not just that it isn't for me, I need to have my projects to be smaller scope especially at first, and to plan my projects step by step better.

## Random thoughts while working on the project
Gotta learn pygame so that might take a lil but I'm so excited! Remember to split it into different files and use classes and shit. yk Object Oriented Programming and what not. FUCK I LOVE PIXEL ART!!!!
