*Unearthing the fossilized remains of The Old Internet*
##### *What is the old internet?*
The old internet or web 1.0 is the early days of the internet, around the 1970's to 1980's, consisting of flashy color and poor quality gifs but most importantly home-made and decentralized. The internet then wasn't just 5-6 social media websites, it was a network of personally made websites by your fellow man not a soulless corporate entity. 
##### *What's wrong with the current internet?*
The current internet or web 2.0 is very corporate and made just for profit instead of the beauty of website making. This results in websites filled with advertisements and websites being very plain-looking or otherwise not very creative. This is awful and sucks the color from even a place as colorful as the world-wide-web. 
##### *What are the alternatives to the current internet?*
Currently, the only alternative to the current internet or the only way to find personal websites would be Neocities. However, a point could be made to not use Neocities as it would be putting all your eggs in one basket and wouldn't keep the decentralized nature of personal websites. 

Unfortunately it seems that if I do get a job in [[Frontend]] development it will most likely involve making some soulless ugly websites. :(
