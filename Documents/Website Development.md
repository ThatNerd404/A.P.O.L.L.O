Websites are pages on the internet that hold information and preform different tasks and require both [[Backend]] and [[Frontend]] development to work. Website development uses languages like [[Html]] , [[Css]] , and [[JavaScript]]. I am actually getting into website development with my website [[Brayden's Innovations]] .  I believe the golden age of website development was in [[The Old Internet]].
